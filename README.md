# Introduction
This repo contains my config of NeoVim, which is currently derived from
the LazyVim distribution of Vim.

Any changes to the Base behaviour of vim can be found [here](/lua/config).
New Plugins and their configuration can be found in [here](/lua/plugins).

To look at the defined plugins check [this](/plugins) out.
Currently there are only custom plugins for some lanugages.

| Language/File type | Plugin File |

| Makefile | [make.lua](/plugins/make.lua)|
