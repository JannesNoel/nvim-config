# Introduction

This repo contains my config of NeoVim, which is currently derived from
the LazyVim distribution of Vim.

Any changes to the Base behaviour of vim can be found [here](/lua/config).
New Plugins and their configuration can be found in [here](/lua/plugins).

## Custom Snippets

The defined snippets can be found in [this](/snippets) folder.
Currently there are only custom snippets for some languages.

| Language/File type | Snippet File |
|:---------|:-----------:|
| C        | [c.lua](/snippets/c.lua)|
| Makefile | [make.lua](/snippets/make.lua)|
